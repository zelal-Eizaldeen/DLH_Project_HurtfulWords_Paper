Regarding\\nprecipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing\\nand could also explain the CXR findings if it is felt that they\\nrepresent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  Other\\nmore typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,\\nPE (see below) and others.  The patient is was intubated and\\nvented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the\\nventilator. Initially with respiratory acidosis with poor O2 due\\nto vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.\\nPatient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the\\ncontinued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due\\nto demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory\\nhold), and current cardiac disease. Despite aggressive\\nbronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she\\ncontinued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial\\nsedation and paralysis. Patient per report was tolerating the\\nventilator at the outside hospital.  It was unclear what was\\ncausing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. After\\nepisode PHIDATEPHI patient required paralysis.  PHIDATEPHI patient\\nesophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a\\nneed for PEEP of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. Patient\\ntolerated PEEP to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped\\nparalytics and lightened sedation.  Patient with prolonged\\nexpiratory phase and stomach/CHF grunt during this time period\\nand CE positive (paO2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back\\non paralytics. While paralyzed PHINAMEPHI problem with lung resistence.\\nAttempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to\\nwean her PEEP, but she continued to need paralysis.  A decision\\nwas made to attempt a PA catheter for better understanding of\\nher hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.\\nDuring this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent\\narrhythmia noted.  She was able to be resuscitated, but required\\nventricular pacing.  Her family then decided to withdraw care\\nand ventilator support.  She subsequently expired from cardiac\\nfailure.\\n.\\nNSTEMI / CAD: Patient has had three coronary events.\\nAt OSH in setting of hypotension, troponin to 6, felt to be\\ndemand ischemia. Here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was\\nstopped PHIDATEPHI.  Per the son, the patient has not had any chest\\npain.\\nHere PHIDATEPHI O/N patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.\\nTachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend\\ndown in response to fluids. Ruled in for NSTEMI (CK 2895, MB 64,\\nTroponin 26). On PHIDATEPHI O/N patient weaned off sedation, became\\nagitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, CE from the time\\non the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ECG\\nsinus LBBB with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating\\nconcordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to\\nPHIDATEPHI. Transfused one unit pRBCs for ischemia with HCT < She\\nwas continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and\\nmetoprolol. Cardiology was following during her stay.\\n.\\n3: Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple espisodes\\nof desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean\\nsedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. PHIDATEPHI,\\npatient oxygenation and CXR responded very well to diuresis.\\nPatient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and\\nhypotension(toponin PHIDATEPHI 26). Demonstrated during this that\\npatient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia\\ncausing CHF.  She was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg TID\\nand diuresed as tolerated.\\n.\\n Leukocytosis: White blood cell count increasing, patient\\nafebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.\\nIn the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious\\nfor PNA. Must also consider stress response with recent\\nNSTEMI/Demand, episode where patient was found down vs\\nalternative sources for infection. PHIDATEPHI also be due to increased\\nsteroids for patient pulmonary presentation. Legionella OSH\\nnegative. She was treated empirically for pneumonia.\\n.\\n Hyperglycemia / Diabetes:\\nWas quite hyperglycemic at the OSH.  She was covered with at\\nPHIHOSPITALPHI insulin gtt. Patient amylase and lipase were within normal\\nlimits. Attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for\\npatient pulmonary disease.\\n.\\n Acute renal failure: At baseline.\\nMost likely flow related given recent hypotension. Admitted with\\nrenal failure, with urine lytes with FeUREA 6% suggesting\\npre-renal etiology. Initial improvement with fluids. Feel\\npatient at baseline (1-5).\\n.\\n Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved\\nPatient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant\\namount of lactate and had a coronary event. When accounting for\\nbicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. Gave\\nback bicarbonate as one liter D5 with 3 amps of bicarb PHIDATEPHI am.\\nPatient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps\\nbicarbonate PHIDATEPHI.\\n.\\n Hypotension: Given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be\\ndiuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute CHF with\\nhypotension. Hypertension upon arrival to PHIHOSPITALPHI. Hypotension with\\nintubation. Hypotension PHIDATEPHI O/N. Hypotensive PHIDATEPHI O/N in\\nsetting of 2 L urine output on lasix and cardiac event. Improved\\nwith decreased in PEEP from 18-\\n.\\n Tachycardia:\\nReoccurred in the setting of hypotension and NSTEMI.\\nOn admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to\\npain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.  PHIDATEPHI be\\ncomponent of volume depletion as well. With improved sedation\\nand IVF boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic PHIDATEPHI.

Regarding\\nprecipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing\\nand could also explain the CXR findings if it is felt that they\\nrepresent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  Other\\nmore typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,\\nPE (see below) and others.  The patient is was intubated and\\nvented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the\\nventilator. Initially with respiratory acidosis with poor O2 due\\nto vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.\\nPatient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the\\ncontinued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due\\nto demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory\\nhold), and current cardiac disease. Despite aggressive\\nbronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she\\ncontinued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial\\nsedation and paralysis. Patient per report was tolerating the\\nventilator at the outside hospital.  It was unclear what was\\ncausing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. After\\nepisode PHIDATEPHI patient required paralysis.  PHIDATEPHI patient\\nesophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a\\nneed for PEEP of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. Patient\\ntolerated PEEP to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped\\nparalytics and lightened sedation.  Patient with prolonged\\nexpiratory phase and stomach/CHF grunt during this time period\\nand CE positive (paO2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back\\non paralytics. While paralyzed PHINAMEPHI problem with lung resistence.\\nAttempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to\\nwean her PEEP, but she continued to need paralysis.  A decision\\nwas made to attempt a PA catheter for better understanding of\\nher hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.\\nDuring this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent\\narrhythmia noted.  She was able to be resuscitated, but required\\nventricular pacing.  Her family then decided to withdraw care\\nand ventilator support.  She subsequently expired from cardiac\\nfailure.\\n.\\nNSTEMI / CAD: Patient has had three coronary events.\\nAt OSH in setting of hypotension, troponin to 6, felt to be\\ndemand ischemia. Here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was\\nstopped PHIDATEPHI.  Per the son, the patient has not had any chest\\npain.\\nHere PHIDATEPHI O/N patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.\\nTachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend\\ndown in response to fluids. Ruled in for NSTEMI (CK 2895, MB 64,\\nTroponin 26). On PHIDATEPHI O/N patient weaned off sedation, became\\nagitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, CE from the time\\non the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ECG\\nsinus LBBB with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating\\nconcordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to\\nPHIDATEPHI. Transfused one unit pRBCs for ischemia with HCT &lt; She\\nwas continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and\\nmetoprolol. Cardiology was following during her stay.\\n.\\n3: Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple espisodes\\nof desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean\\nsedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. PHIDATEPHI,\\npatient oxygenation and CXR responded very well to diuresis.\\nPatient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and\\nhypotension(toponin PHIDATEPHI 26). Demonstrated during this that\\npatient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia\\ncausing CHF.  She was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg TID\\nand diuresed as tolerated.\\n.\\n Leukocytosis: White blood cell count increasing, patient\\nafebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.\\nIn the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious\\nfor PNA. Must also consider stress response with recent\\nNSTEMI/Demand, episode where patient was found down vs\\nalternative sources for infection. PHIDATEPHI also be due to increased\\nsteroids for patient pulmonary presentation. Legionella OSH\\nnegative. She was treated empirically for pneumonia.\\n.\\n Hyperglycemia / Diabetes:\\nWas quite hyperglycemic at the OSH.  She was covered with at\\nPHIHOSPITALPHI insulin gtt. Patient amylase and lipase were within normal\\nlimits. Attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for\\npatient pulmonary disease.\\n.\\n Acute renal failure: At baseline.\\nMost likely flow related given recent hypotension. Admitted with\\nrenal failure, with urine lytes with FeUREA 6% suggesting\\npre-renal etiology. Initial improvement with fluids. Feel\\npatient at baseline (1-5).\\n.\\n Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved\\nPatient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant\\namount of lactate and had a coronary event. When accounting for\\nbicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. Gave\\nback bicarbonate as one liter D5 with 3 amps of bicarb PHIDATEPHI am.\\nPatient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps\\nbicarbonate PHIDATEPHI.\\n.\\n Hypotension: Given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be\\ndiuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute CHF with\\nhypotension. Hypertension upon arrival to PHIHOSPITALPHI. Hypotension with\\nintubation. Hypotension PHIDATEPHI O/N. Hypotensive PHIDATEPHI O/N in\\nsetting of 2 L urine output on lasix and cardiac event. Improved\\nwith decreased in PEEP from 18-\\n.\\n Tachycardia:\\nReoccurred in the setting of hypotension and NSTEMI.\\nOn admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to\\npain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.  PHIDATEPHI be\\ncomponent of volume depletion as well. With improved sedation\\nand IVF boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic PHIDATEPHI. Only\\nconcern in the setting of tachycardia and respiratory distress\\nin relatively sedentary patient is PE. Although at this point\\nlow suspicion given physical exam, and negative LENIs.

On the day prior\\nto transfer, she ws out in public and experienced a sudden onset\\nof worsened dyspnea.  She asked bystanders to call EMS and by\\nthe time they arrived she was found unresponsive; did have a\\npulse but was cyanotic and was intubed in the field.\\n.\\nAt the OSH, initial CXR showed congestive heart failure.  She\\nwas given IV lasix and placed on a nitro drip.  After several\\nhundred ml of urine was produced she became hypotensive,\\nrequiring volume resuscitation and phenylephrine.

It was\\nfelt that this correlated, at least in part, to leaving a home\\nenvironment which had previously been infested with mold.  Over\\nthe last week or so, boxes from her prior home had been brought\\nto her new home; it was the patient's feeling that these boxes\\nhad contained mold and were the precipitant for her current\\nexacerbation.\\nPast Medical History:\\nCoronary artery disease:\\n- PHIDATEPHI OM1 80% stenosis s/p stent, followed by Dr. PHINAMEPHI\\nAsthma:  PFTs in PHIDATEPHI showed FVC 76%, FEV1 76%, MMF 35%,\\nFEV1/FVC 100%.\\nDiabetes mellitus - Followed by PHINAMEPHI\\nHypertention\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\\nPolymyalgia rheumatica, on prednisone 10 mg\\nOSA\\nIntermittent LBBB - R/O x 2 in setting of this, and LBBB\\nresolved during both admissions\\nSocial History:\\nHas a 40 pack year hx of smoking, no current tob/no ETOH.

Regarding\\nprecipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing\\nand could also explain the CXR findings if it is felt that they\\nrepresent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  Other\\nmore typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,\\nPE (see below) and others.  The patient is was intubated and\\nvented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the\\nventilator. Initially with respiratory acidosis with poor O2 due\\nto vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.\\nPatient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the\\ncontinued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due\\nto demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory\\nhold), and current cardiac disease. Despite aggressive\\nbronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she\\ncontinued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial\\nsedation and paralysis. Patient per report was tolerating the\\nventilator at the outside hospital.  It was unclear what was\\ncausing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. After\\nepisode PHIDATEPHI patient required paralysis.  PHIDATEPHI patient\\nesophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a\\nneed for PEEP of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. Patient\\ntolerated PEEP to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped\\nparalytics and lightened sedation.  Patient with prolonged\\nexpiratory phase and stomach/CHF grunt during this time period\\nand CE positive (paO2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back\\non paralytics. While paralyzed PHINAMEPHI problem with lung resistence.\\nAttempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to\\nwean her PEEP, but she continued to need paralysis.  A decision\\nwas made to attempt a PA catheter for better understanding of\\nher hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.\\nDuring this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent\\narrhythmia noted.  She was able to be resuscitated, but required\\nventricular pacing.  Her family then decided to withdraw care\\nand ventilator support.  She subsequently expired from cardiac\\nfailure.\\n.\\nNSTEMI / CAD: Patient has had three coronary events.\\nAt OSH in setting of hypotension, troponin to 6, felt to be\\ndemand ischemia. Here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was\\nstopped PHIDATEPHI.  Per the son, the patient has not had any chest\\npain.\\nHere PHIDATEPHI O/N patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.\\nTachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend\\ndown in response to fluids. Ruled in for NSTEMI (CK 2895, MB 64,\\nTroponin 26). On PHIDATEPHI O/N patient weaned off sedation, became\\nagitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, CE from the time\\non the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ECG\\nsinus LBBB with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating\\nconcordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to\\nPHIDATEPHI. Transfused one unit pRBCs for ischemia with HCT < She\\nwas continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and\\nmetoprolol. Cardiology was following during her stay.\\n.\\n3: Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple espisodes\\nof desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean\\nsedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. PHIDATEPHI,\\npatient oxygenation and CXR responded very well to diuresis.\\nPatient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and\\nhypotension(toponin PHIDATEPHI 26). Demonstrated during this that\\npatient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia\\ncausing CHF.  She was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg TID\\nand diuresed as tolerated.\\n.\\n Leukocytosis: White blood cell count increasing, patient\\nafebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.\\nIn the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious\\nfor PNA. Must also consider stress response with recent\\nNSTEMI/Demand, episode where patient was found down vs\\nalternative sources for infection. PHIDATEPHI also be due to increased\\nsteroids for patient pulmonary presentation. Legionella OSH\\nnegative. She was treated empirically for pneumonia.\\n.\\n Hyperglycemia / Diabetes:\\nWas quite hyperglycemic at the OSH.  She was covered with at\\nPHIHOSPITALPHI insulin gtt. Patient amylase and lipase were within normal\\nlimits. Attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for\\npatient pulmonary disease.\\n.\\n Acute renal failure: At baseline.\\nMost likely flow related given recent hypotension. Admitted with\\nrenal failure, with urine lytes with FeUREA 6% suggesting\\npre-renal etiology. Initial improvement with fluids. Feel\\npatient at baseline (1-5).\\n.\\n Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved\\nPatient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant\\namount of lactate and had a coronary event. When accounting for\\nbicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. Gave\\nback bicarbonate as one liter D5 with 3 amps of bicarb PHIDATEPHI am.\\nPatient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps\\nbicarbonate PHIDATEPHI.\\n.\\n Hypotension: Given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be\\ndiuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute CHF with\\nhypotension. Hypertension upon arrival to PHIHOSPITALPHI. Hypotension with\\nintubation. Hypotension PHIDATEPHI O/N. Hypotensive PHIDATEPHI O/N in\\nsetting of 2 L urine output on lasix and cardiac event. Improved\\nwith decreased in PEEP from 18-\\n.\\n Tachycardia:\\nReoccurred in the setting of hypotension and NSTEMI.\\nOn admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to\\npain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.  PHIDATEPHI be\\ncomponent of volume depletion as well. With improved sedation\\nand IVF boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic PHIDATEPHI. Only\\nconcern in the setting of tachycardia and respiratory distress\\nin relatively sedentary patient is PE. Although at this point\\nlow suspicion given physical exam, and negative LENIs.

Regarding\\nprecipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing\\nand could also explain the CXR findings if it is felt that they\\nrepresent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  Other\\nmore typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,\\nPE (see below) and others.  The patient is was intubated and\\nvented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the\\nventilator. Initially with respiratory acidosis with poor O2 due\\nto vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.\\nPatient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the\\ncontinued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due\\nto demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory\\nhold), and current cardiac disease. Despite aggressive\\nbronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she\\ncontinued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial\\nsedation and paralysis. Patient per report was tolerating the\\nventilator at the outside hospital.  It was unclear what was\\ncausing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. After\\nepisode PHIDATEPHI patient required paralysis.  PHIDATEPHI patient\\nesophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a\\nneed for PEEP of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. Patient\\ntolerated PEEP to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped\\nparalytics and lightened sedation.  Patient with prolonged\\nexpiratory phase and stomach/CHF grunt during this time period\\nand CE positive (paO2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back\\non paralytics. While paralyzed PHINAMEPHI problem with lung resistence.\\nAttempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to\\nwean her PEEP, but she continued to need paralysis.  A decision\\nwas made to attempt a PA catheter for better understanding of\\nher hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.\\nDuring this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent\\narrhythmia noted.  She was able to be resuscitated, but required\\nventricular pacing.  Her family then decided to withdraw care\\nand ventilator support.  She subsequently expired from cardiac\\nfailure.\\n.\\nNSTEMI / CAD: Patient has had three coronary events.\\nAt OSH in setting of hypotension, troponin to 6, felt to be\\ndemand ischemia. Here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was\\nstopped PHIDATEPHI.  Per the son, the patient has not had any chest\\npain.\\nHere PHIDATEPHI O/N patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.\\nTachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend\\ndown in response to fluids. Ruled in for NSTEMI (CK 2895, MB 64,\\nTroponin 26). On PHIDATEPHI O/N patient weaned off sedation, became\\nagitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, CE from the time\\non the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ECG\\nsinus LBBB with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating\\nconcordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to\\nPHIDATEPHI. Transfused one unit pRBCs for ischemia with HCT &lt; She\\nwas continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and\\nmetoprolol. Cardiology was following during her stay.\\n.\\n3: Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple espisodes\\nof desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean\\nsedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. PHIDATEPHI,\\npatient oxygenation and CXR responded very well to diuresis.\\nPatient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and\\nhypotension(toponin PHIDATEPHI 26). Demonstrated during this that\\npatient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia\\ncausing CHF.  She was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg TID\\nand diuresed as tolerated.\\n.\\n Leukocytosis: White blood cell count increasing, patient\\nafebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.\\nIn the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious\\nfor PNA. Must also consider stress response with recent\\nNSTEMI/Demand, episode where patient was found down vs\\nalternative sources for infection. PHIDATEPHI also be due to increased\\nsteroids for patient pulmonary presentation. Legionella OSH\\nnegative. She was treated empirically for pneumonia.\\n.\\n Hyperglycemia / Diabetes:\\nWas quite hyperglycemic at the OSH.  She was covered with at\\nPHIHOSPITALPHI insulin gtt. Patient amylase and lipase were within normal\\nlimits. Attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for\\npatient pulmonary disease.\\n.\\n Acute renal failure: At baseline.\\nMost likely flow related given recent hypotension. Admitted with\\nrenal failure, with urine lytes with FeUREA 6% suggesting\\npre-renal etiology. Initial improvement with fluids. Feel\\npatient at baseline (1-5).\\n.\\n Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved\\nPatient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant\\namount of lactate and had a coronary event. When accounting for\\nbicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. Gave\\nback bicarbonate as one liter D5 with 3 amps of bicarb PHIDATEPHI am.\\nPatient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps\\nbicarbonate PHIDATEPHI.\\n.\\n Hypotension: Given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be\\ndiuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute CHF with\\nhypotension. Hypertension upon arrival to PHIHOSPITALPHI. Hypotension with\\nintubation. Hypotension PHIDATEPHI O/N. Hypotensive PHIDATEPHI O/N in\\nsetting of 2 L urine output on lasix and cardiac event. Improved\\nwith decreased in PEEP from 18-\\n.\\n Tachycardia:\\nReoccurred in the setting of hypotension and NSTEMI.\\nOn admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to\\npain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.  PHIDATEPHI be\\ncomponent of volume depletion as well. With improved sedation\\nand IVF boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic PHIDATEPHI. Only\\nconcern in the setting of tachycardia and respiratory distress\\nin relatively sedentary patient is PE. Although at this point\\nlow suspicion given physical exam, and negative LENIs.  She was\\ngiven metoprolol for rate control.\\n.\\nPPx:\\nheparin gtt, PPI.\\nAccess:\\nPlaced R IJ in IR PHIDATEPHI.

On the day prior\\nto transfer, she ws out in public and experienced a sudden onset\\nof worsened dyspnea.  She asked bystanders to call EMS and by\\nthe time they arrived she was found unresponsive; did have a\\npulse but was cyanotic and was intubed in the field.\\n.\\nAt the OSH, initial CXR showed congestive heart failure.  She\\nwas given IV lasix and placed on a nitro drip.  After several\\nhundred ml of urine was produced she became hypotensive,\\nrequiring volume resuscitation and phenylephrine.  For a\\npossible pneumonia she received ceftriaxone and azithromycin.\\nShe was transfused one unit of pRBC for a hct of   An echo\\ndone at the OSH showed apical hypokinesis with a fairly\\npreserved LVEF.\\n.\\nIn speaking with the son, he reports that over the past six\\nmonths the patient's asthma has been under excellent control.\\nShe was not requiring her albuterol rescue on most days.  It was\\nfelt that this correlated, at least in part, to leaving a home\\nenvironment which had previously been infested with mold.  Over\\nthe last week or so, boxes from her prior home had been brought\\nto her new home; it was the patient's feeling that these boxes\\nhad contained mold and were the precipitant for her current\\nexacerbation.\\nPast Medical History:\\nCoronary artery disease:\\n- PHIDATEPHI OM1 80% stenosis s/p stent, followed by Dr. PHINAMEPHI\\nAsthma:  PFTs in PHIDATEPHI showed FVC 76%, FEV1 76%, MMF 35%,\\nFEV1/FVC 100%.\\nDiabetes mellitus - Followed by PHINAMEPHI\\nHypertention\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\\nPolymyalgia rheumatica, on prednisone 10 mg\\nOSA\\nIntermittent LBBB - R/O x 2 in setting of this, and LBBB\\nresolved during both admissions\\nSocial History:\\nHas a 40 pack year hx of smoking, no current tob/no ETOH.

Regarding\\nprecipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing\\nand could also explain the CXR findings if it is felt that they\\nrepresent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  Other\\nmore typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,\\nPE (see below) and others.  The patient is was intubated and\\nvented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the\\nventilator. Initially with respiratory acidosis with poor O2 due\\nto vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.\\nPatient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the\\ncontinued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due\\nto demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory\\nhold), and current cardiac disease. Despite aggressive\\nbronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she\\ncontinued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial\\nsedation and paralysis. Patient per report was tolerating the\\nventilator at the outside hospital.  It was unclear what was\\ncausing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. After\\nepisode PHIDATEPHI patient required paralysis.  PHIDATEPHI patient\\nesophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a\\nneed for PEEP of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. Patient\\ntolerated PEEP to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped\\nparalytics and lightened sedation.  Patient with prolonged\\nexpiratory phase and stomach/CHF grunt during this time period\\nand CE positive (paO2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back\\non paralytics. While paralyzed PHINAMEPHI problem with lung resistence.\\nAttempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to\\nwean her PEEP, but she continued to need paralysis.  A decision\\nwas made to attempt a PA catheter for better understanding of\\nher hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.\\nDuring this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent\\narrhythmia noted.  She was able to be resuscitated, but required\\nventricular pacing.  Her family then decided to withdraw care\\nand ventilator support.  She subsequently expired from cardiac\\nfailure.\\n.\\nNSTEMI / CAD: Patient has had three coronary events.\\nAt OSH in setting of hypotension, troponin to 6, felt to be\\ndemand ischemia. Here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was\\nstopped PHIDATEPHI.  Per the son, the patient has not had any chest\\npain.\\nHere PHIDATEPHI O/N patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.\\nTachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend\\ndown in response to fluids. Ruled in for NSTEMI (CK 2895, MB 64,\\nTroponin 26). On PHIDATEPHI O/N patient weaned off sedation, became\\nagitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, CE from the time\\non the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ECG\\nsinus LBBB with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating\\nconcordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to\\nPHIDATEPHI. Transfused one unit pRBCs for ischemia with HCT < She\\nwas continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and\\nmetoprolol. Cardiology was following during her stay.\\n.\\n3: Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple espisodes\\nof desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean\\nsedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. PHIDATEPHI,\\npatient oxygenation and CXR responded very well to diuresis.\\nPatient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and\\nhypotension(toponin PHIDATEPHI 26). Demonstrated during this that\\npatient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia\\ncausing CHF.  She was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg TID\\nand diuresed as tolerated.\\n.\\n Leukocytosis: White blood cell count increasing, patient\\nafebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.\\nIn the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious\\nfor PNA. Must also consider stress response with recent\\nNSTEMI/Demand, episode where patient was found down vs\\nalternative sources for infection. PHIDATEPHI also be due to increased\\nsteroids for patient pulmonary presentation. Legionella OSH\\nnegative. She was treated empirically for pneumonia.\\n.\\n Hyperglycemia / Diabetes:\\nWas quite hyperglycemic at the OSH.  She was covered with at\\nPHIHOSPITALPHI insulin gtt. Patient amylase and lipase were within normal\\nlimits. Attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for\\npatient pulmonary disease.\\n.\\n Acute renal failure: At baseline.\\nMost likely flow related given recent hypotension. Admitted with\\nrenal failure, with urine lytes with FeUREA 6% suggesting\\npre-renal etiology. Initial improvement with fluids. Feel\\npatient at baseline (1-5).\\n.\\n Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved\\nPatient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant\\namount of lactate and had a coronary event. When accounting for\\nbicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. Gave\\nback bicarbonate as one liter D5 with 3 amps of bicarb PHIDATEPHI am.\\nPatient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps\\nbicarbonate PHIDATEPHI.\\n.\\n Hypotension: Given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be\\ndiuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute CHF with\\nhypotension. Hypertension upon arrival to PHIHOSPITALPHI. Hypotension with\\nintubation. Hypotension PHIDATEPHI O/N. Hypotensive PHIDATEPHI O/N in\\nsetting of 2 L urine output on lasix and cardiac event. Improved\\nwith decreased in PEEP from 18-\\n.\\n Tachycardia:\\nReoccurred in the setting of hypotension and NSTEMI.\\nOn admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to\\npain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.  PHIDATEPHI be\\ncomponent of volume depletion as well. With improved sedation\\nand IVF boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic PHIDATEPHI. Only\\nconcern in the setting of tachycardia and respiratory distress\\nin relatively sedentary patient is PE. Although at this point\\nlow suspicion given physical exam, and negative LENIs.

Regarding\\nprecipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing\\nand could also explain the CXR findings if it is felt that they\\nrepresent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  Other\\nmore typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,\\nPE (see below) and others.  The patient is was intubated and\\nvented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the\\nventilator. Initially with respiratory acidosis with poor O2 due\\nto vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.\\nPatient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the\\ncontinued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due\\nto demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory\\nhold), and current cardiac disease. Despite aggressive\\nbronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she\\ncontinued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial\\nsedation and paralysis. Patient per report was tolerating the\\nventilator at the outside hospital.  It was unclear what was\\ncausing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. After\\nepisode PHIDATEPHI patient required paralysis.  PHIDATEPHI patient\\nesophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a\\nneed for PEEP of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. Patient\\ntolerated PEEP to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped\\nparalytics and lightened sedation.  Patient with prolonged\\nexpiratory phase and stomach/CHF grunt during this time period\\nand CE positive (paO2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back\\non paralytics. While paralyzed PHINAMEPHI problem with lung resistence.\\nAttempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to\\nwean her PEEP, but she continued to need paralysis.  A decision\\nwas made to attempt a PA catheter for better understanding of\\nher hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.\\nDuring this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent\\narrhythmia noted.  She was able to be resuscitated, but required\\nventricular pacing.  Her family then decided to withdraw care\\nand ventilator support.  She subsequently expired from cardiac\\nfailure.\\n.\\nNSTEMI / CAD: Patient has had three coronary events.\\nAt OSH in setting of hypotension, troponin to 6, felt to be\\ndemand ischemia. Here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was\\nstopped PHIDATEPHI.  Per the son, the patient has not had any chest\\npain.\\nHere PHIDATEPHI O/N patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.\\nTachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend\\ndown in response to fluids. Ruled in for NSTEMI (CK 2895, MB 64,\\nTroponin 26). On PHIDATEPHI O/N patient weaned off sedation, became\\nagitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, CE from the time\\non the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ECG\\nsinus LBBB with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating\\nconcordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to\\nPHIDATEPHI. Transfused one unit pRBCs for ischemia with HCT &lt; She\\nwas continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and\\nmetoprolol. Cardiology was following during her stay.\\n.\\n3: Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple espisodes\\nof desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean\\nsedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. PHIDATEPHI,\\npatient oxygenation and CXR responded very well to diuresis.\\nPatient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and\\nhypotension(toponin PHIDATEPHI 26). Demonstrated during this that\\npatient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia\\ncausing CHF.  She was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg TID\\nand diuresed as tolerated.\\n.\\n Leukocytosis: White blood cell count increasing, patient\\nafebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.\\nIn the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious\\nfor PNA. Must also consider stress response with recent\\nNSTEMI/Demand, episode where patient was found down vs\\nalternative sources for infection. PHIDATEPHI also be due to increased\\nsteroids for patient pulmonary presentation. Legionella OSH\\nnegative. She was treated empirically for pneumonia.\\n.\\n Hyperglycemia / Diabetes:\\nWas quite hyperglycemic at the OSH.  She was covered with at\\nPHIHOSPITALPHI insulin gtt. Patient amylase and lipase were within normal\\nlimits. Attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for\\npatient pulmonary disease.\\n.\\n Acute renal failure: At baseline.\\nMost likely flow related given recent hypotension. Admitted with\\nrenal failure, with urine lytes with FeUREA 6% suggesting\\npre-renal etiology. Initial improvement with fluids. Feel\\npatient at baseline (1-5).\\n.\\n Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved\\nPatient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant\\namount of lactate and had a coronary event. When accounting for\\nbicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. Gave\\nback bicarbonate as one liter D5 with 3 amps of bicarb PHIDATEPHI am.\\nPatient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps\\nbicarbonate PHIDATEPHI.\\n.\\n Hypotension: Given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be\\ndiuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute CHF with\\nhypotension. Hypertension upon arrival to PHIHOSPITALPHI. Hypotension with\\nintubation. Hypotension PHIDATEPHI O/N. Hypotensive PHIDATEPHI O/N in\\nsetting of 2 L urine output on lasix and cardiac event. Improved\\nwith decreased in PEEP from 18-\\n.\\n Tachycardia:\\nReoccurred in the setting of hypotension and NSTEMI.\\nOn admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to\\npain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.  PHIDATEPHI be\\ncomponent of volume depletion as well. With improved sedation\\nand IVF boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic PHIDATEPHI. Only\\nconcern in the setting of tachycardia and respiratory distress\\nin relatively sedentary patient is PE. Although at this point\\nlow suspicion given physical exam, and negative LENIs.  She was\\ngiven metoprolol for rate control.\\n.\\nPPx:\\nheparin gtt, PPI.\\nAccess:\\nPlaced R IJ in IR PHIDATEPHI.

On the day prior\\nto transfer, she ws out in public and experienced a sudden onset\\nof worsened dyspnea.  She asked bystanders to call EMS and by\\nthe time they arrived she was found unresponsive; did have a\\npulse but was cyanotic and was intubed in the field.\\n.\\nAt the OSH, initial CXR showed congestive heart failure.  She\\nwas given IV lasix and placed on a nitro drip.  After several\\nhundred ml of urine was produced she became hypotensive,\\nrequiring volume resuscitation and phenylephrine.  For a\\npossible pneumonia she received ceftriaxone and azithromycin.\\nShe was transfused one unit of pRBC for a hct of   An echo\\ndone at the OSH showed apical hypokinesis with a fairly\\npreserved LVEF.\\n.\\nIn speaking with the son, he reports that over the past six\\nmonths the patient's asthma has been under excellent control.\\nShe was not requiring her albuterol rescue on most days.  It was\\nfelt that this correlated, at least in part, to leaving a home\\nenvironment which had previously been infested with mold.  Over\\nthe last week or so, boxes from her prior home had been brought\\nto her new home; it was the patient's feeling that these boxes\\nhad contained mold and were the precipitant for her current\\nexacerbation.\\nPast Medical History:\\nCoronary artery disease:\\n- PHIDATEPHI OM1 80% stenosis s/p stent, followed by Dr. PHINAMEPHI\\nAsthma:  PFTs in PHIDATEPHI showed FVC 76%, FEV1 76%, MMF 35%,\\nFEV1/FVC 100%.\\nDiabetes mellitus - Followed by PHINAMEPHI\\nHypertention\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\\nPolymyalgia rheumatica, on prednisone 10 mg\\nOSA\\nIntermittent LBBB - R/O x 2 in setting of this, and LBBB\\nresolved during both admissions\\nSocial History:\\nHas a 40 pack year hx of smoking, no current tob/no ETOH.

Regarding\\nprecipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing\\nand could also explain the CXR findings if it is felt that they\\nrepresent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  Other\\nmore typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,\\nPE (see below) and others.  The patient is was intubated and\\nvented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the\\nventilator. Initially with respiratory acidosis with poor O2 due\\nto vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.\\nPatient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the\\ncontinued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due\\nto demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory\\nhold), and current cardiac disease. Despite aggressive\\nbronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she\\ncontinued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial\\nsedation and paralysis. Patient per report was tolerating the\\nventilator at the outside hospital.  It was unclear what was\\ncausing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. After\\nepisode PHIDATEPHI patient required paralysis.  PHIDATEPHI patient\\nesophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a\\nneed for PEEP of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. Patient\\ntolerated PEEP to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped\\nparalytics and lightened sedation.  Patient with prolonged\\nexpiratory phase and stomach/CHF grunt during this time period\\nand CE positive (paO2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back\\non paralytics. While paralyzed PHINAMEPHI problem with lung resistence.\\nAttempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to\\nwean her PEEP, but she continued to need paralysis.  A decision\\nwas made to attempt a PA catheter for better understanding of\\nher hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.\\nDuring this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent\\narrhythmia noted.  She was able to be resuscitated, but required\\nventricular pacing.  Her family then decided to withdraw care\\nand ventilator support.  She subsequently expired from cardiac\\nfailure.\\n.\\nNSTEMI / CAD: Patient has had three coronary events.\\nAt OSH in setting of hypotension, troponin to 6, felt to be\\ndemand ischemia. Here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was\\nstopped PHIDATEPHI.  Per the son, the patient has not had any chest\\npain.\\nHere PHIDATEPHI O/N patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.\\nTachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend\\ndown in response to fluids. Ruled in for NSTEMI (CK 2895, MB 64,\\nTroponin 26). On PHIDATEPHI O/N patient weaned off sedation, became\\nagitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, CE from the time\\non the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ECG\\nsinus LBBB with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating\\nconcordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to\\nPHIDATEPHI. Transfused one unit pRBCs for ischemia with HCT < She\\nwas continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and\\nmetoprolol. Cardiology was following during her stay.\\n.\\n3: Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple espisodes\\nof desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean\\nsedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. PHIDATEPHI,\\npatient oxygenation and CXR responded very well to diuresis.\\nPatient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and\\nhypotension(toponin PHIDATEPHI 26). Demonstrated during this that\\npatient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia\\ncausing CHF.  She was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg TID\\nand diuresed as tolerated.\\n.\\n Leukocytosis: White blood cell count increasing, patient\\nafebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.\\nIn the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious\\nfor PNA. Must also consider stress response with recent\\nNSTEMI/Demand, episode where patient was found down vs\\nalternative sources for infection. PHIDATEPHI also be due to increased\\nsteroids for patient pulmonary presentation. Legionella OSH\\nnegative. She was treated empirically for pneumonia.\\n.\\n Hyperglycemia / Diabetes:\\nWas quite hyperglycemic at the OSH.  She was covered with at\\nPHIHOSPITALPHI insulin gtt. Patient amylase and lipase were within normal\\nlimits. Attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for\\npatient pulmonary disease.\\n.\\n Acute renal failure: At baseline.\\nMost likely flow related given recent hypotension. Admitted with\\nrenal failure, with urine lytes with FeUREA 6% suggesting\\npre-renal etiology. Initial improvement with fluids. Feel\\npatient at baseline (1-5).\\n.\\n Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved\\nPatient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant\\namount of lactate and had a coronary event. When accounting for\\nbicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. Gave\\nback bicarbonate as one liter D5 with 3 amps of bicarb PHIDATEPHI am.\\nPatient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps\\nbicarbonate PHIDATEPHI.\\n.\\n Hypotension: Given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be\\ndiuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute CHF with\\nhypotension. Hypertension upon arrival to PHIHOSPITALPHI. Hypotension with\\nintubation. Hypotension PHIDATEPHI O/N. Hypotensive PHIDATEPHI O/N in\\nsetting of 2 L urine output on lasix and cardiac event. Improved\\nwith decreased in PEEP from 18-\\n.\\n Tachycardia:\\nReoccurred in the setting of hypotension and NSTEMI.\\nOn admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to\\npain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.  PHIDATEPHI be\\ncomponent of volume depletion as well. With improved sedation\\nand IVF boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic PHIDATEPHI. Only\\nconcern in the setting of tachycardia and respiratory distress\\nin relatively sedentary patient is PE. Although at this point\\nlow suspicion given physical exam, and negative LENIs.

Regarding\\nprecipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing\\nand could also explain the CXR findings if it is felt that they\\nrepresent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  Other\\nmore typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,\\nPE (see below) and others.  The patient is was intubated and\\nvented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the\\nventilator. Initially with respiratory acidosis with poor O2 due\\nto vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.\\nPatient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the\\ncontinued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due\\nto demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory\\nhold), and current cardiac disease. Despite aggressive\\nbronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she\\ncontinued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial\\nsedation and paralysis. Patient per report was tolerating the\\nventilator at the outside hospital.  It was unclear what was\\ncausing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. After\\nepisode PHIDATEPHI patient required paralysis.  PHIDATEPHI patient\\nesophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a\\nneed for PEEP of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. Patient\\ntolerated PEEP to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped\\nparalytics and lightened sedation.  Patient with prolonged\\nexpiratory phase and stomach/CHF grunt during this time period\\nand CE positive (paO2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back\\non paralytics. While paralyzed PHINAMEPHI problem with lung resistence.\\nAttempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to\\nwean her PEEP, but she continued to need paralysis.  A decision\\nwas made to attempt a PA catheter for better understanding of\\nher hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.\\nDuring this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent\\narrhythmia noted.  She was able to be resuscitated, but required\\nventricular pacing.  Her family then decided to withdraw care\\nand ventilator support.  She subsequently expired from cardiac\\nfailure.\\n.\\nNSTEMI / CAD: Patient has had three coronary events.\\nAt OSH in setting of hypotension, troponin to 6, felt to be\\ndemand ischemia. Here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was\\nstopped PHIDATEPHI.  Per the son, the patient has not had any chest\\npain.\\nHere PHIDATEPHI O/N patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.\\nTachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend\\ndown in response to fluids. Ruled in for NSTEMI (CK 2895, MB 64,\\nTroponin 26). On PHIDATEPHI O/N patient weaned off sedation, became\\nagitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, CE from the time\\non the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ECG\\nsinus LBBB with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating\\nconcordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to\\nPHIDATEPHI. Transfused one unit pRBCs for ischemia with HCT &lt; She\\nwas continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and\\nmetoprolol. Cardiology was following during her stay.\\n.\\n3: Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple espisodes\\nof desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean\\nsedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. PHIDATEPHI,\\npatient oxygenation and CXR responded very well to diuresis.\\nPatient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and\\nhypotension(toponin PHIDATEPHI 26). Demonstrated during this that\\npatient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia\\ncausing CHF.  She was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg TID\\nand diuresed as tolerated.\\n.\\n Leukocytosis: White blood cell count increasing, patient\\nafebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.\\nIn the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious\\nfor PNA. Must also consider stress response with recent\\nNSTEMI/Demand, episode where patient was found down vs\\nalternative sources for infection. PHIDATEPHI also be due to increased\\nsteroids for patient pulmonary presentation. Legionella OSH\\nnegative. She was treated empirically for pneumonia.\\n.\\n Hyperglycemia / Diabetes:\\nWas quite hyperglycemic at the OSH.  She was covered with at\\nPHIHOSPITALPHI insulin gtt. Patient amylase and lipase were within normal\\nlimits. Attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for\\npatient pulmonary disease.\\n.\\n Acute renal failure: At baseline.\\nMost likely flow related given recent hypotension. Admitted with\\nrenal failure, with urine lytes with FeUREA 6% suggesting\\npre-renal etiology. Initial improvement with fluids. Feel\\npatient at baseline (1-5).\\n.\\n Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved\\nPatient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant\\namount of lactate and had a coronary event. When accounting for\\nbicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. Gave\\nback bicarbonate as one liter D5 with 3 amps of bicarb PHIDATEPHI am.\\nPatient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps\\nbicarbonate PHIDATEPHI.\\n.\\n Hypotension: Given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be\\ndiuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute CHF with\\nhypotension. Hypertension upon arrival to PHIHOSPITALPHI. Hypotension with\\nintubation. Hypotension PHIDATEPHI O/N. Hypotensive PHIDATEPHI O/N in\\nsetting of 2 L urine output on lasix and cardiac event. Improved\\nwith decreased in PEEP from 18-\\n.\\n Tachycardia:\\nReoccurred in the setting of hypotension and NSTEMI.\\nOn admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to\\npain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.  PHIDATEPHI be\\ncomponent of volume depletion as well. With improved sedation\\nand IVF boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic PHIDATEPHI. Only\\nconcern in the setting of tachycardia and respiratory distress\\nin relatively sedentary patient is PE. Although at this point\\nlow suspicion given physical exam, and negative LENIs.  She was\\ngiven metoprolol for rate control.\\n.\\nPPx:\\nheparin gtt, PPI.\\nAccess:\\nPlaced R IJ in IR PHIDATEPHI.
